## Description
This workshop will be an introduction to bash and the command line. The command line is how coders interact with their computers and the file structures within. As psychology researchers, we typically use the command line to manage our files, organize our data, install programs, and run other scripts.

## Prerequisites
1. A bash command line interface.
    a. For Mac users, this is already available to you via the "terminal" program.
    b. for PC users, you can download and install bash via [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

## To-do before the tutorial
1. Nothing! The tutorial will take you through every step needed to get started coding in bash.

## Tutorial objectives:
- Practice coding syntax
