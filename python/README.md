# Python Tutorial

__**Instructor:**__ Katie Jobson


## Description
This workshop will be an introduction to python. In this tutorial, you will create code and create a script in the Spyder environment/interface. The focus of this workshop will be preparing and cleaning behavioral data to be analyzed later. Often, our data comes to us in a format that is not ideal for the analysis we want to do. This tutorial will show you how we can play around and manage our data to suit our needs, via the pandas package which is like Excel for coders.

## Prerequisites
1. Spyder, via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).

## To-do before the tutorial
1. It would be helpful to do the [bash tutorial](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/intro-to-coding-2021//tree/main/bash) before this one, unless you are already familiar with bash.
2. Download the relevant files and organize them based on the bash tutorial

## Tutorial objectives:
- Integrate what we know about bash into Python
- Learn how to clean data using Python packages
