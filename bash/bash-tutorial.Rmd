# Introduction

## Learning Objectives
- Practice coding syntax
- Learn how to troubleshoot
- Learn basic coding operations (if-statements, for loops, etc.)


# Basic Bash Commands

## Terminal
The terminal is a way of interacting within your computer that does not require a graphic user interface (GUI). In the olden times, computers did not have a mouse, desktop, folders, and program icons. If you wanted to do something on a computer, you had to give the computer very specific instructions. If the terminal is the "old" way of doing things, why do people still use the terminal today? One reason, and a point we will stress throughout the bootcamp, is for automation. When you interact with a computer via traditional ways, you will have to repeat very redundant motions. Let's say you want to rename 100 files. You will have to right click on each one, hit "rename", and then type out the new name of the file, all while making small but infuriating mistakes at each of these steps. Sometimes you might also make small mistakes that can be harder to catch later, such as if you were to add an extra "a" somewhere. With the terminal, and coding in general, we can create a set of commands, test it on a couple of files, and then run them on all of the other files. Then, if we ever have to do something similar in the future, we will have that code ready, and not have to do redundant things again.

But before we get into what is possible with the termial, we will have to introduce you to some concepts and basic commands to get you using the terminal. 


## Listing
When you open a folder, you can immediate see the files that are inside. In the terminal you will have to give it a command to see what is inside (ignore this con, the pros are coming soon). The command to "list" the contents of the **current directory** is:

```{eval=FALSE}
ls
```

But what is a "current directory", or even a regular "directory". You can think of a directory as a folder, and the current directory would be the current folder. Okay, so now we can see what is in our current directory, but where are we anyways?! Well, if we were using our computer the traditional way, we might have a bar at the top of our finder window that lists the entire address of where we are. In the terminal, we will also have to provide the command to Print the Current Directory.

```{eval=FALSE}
pwd
```

# Directories
Another word you might see used is "subdirectories", which is just a directory within a directory. Directories are relative and so any given directory can be a subdirectory, depending on your point of reference. One import directory to know is the **home directory**. Computers have a default directory where you generally start once you open the terminal.If you ever find yourself somewhere and want to go to the home directory, just used the "change directory" command:

```{eval=FALSE}
cd
```

#### Exercise 1
Use one of the commands we have used to find the path (location) of the home directory.


## Navigating Directories

### Know where you are going
To navigate through directories, we can used the "cd" command and input a subdirectory to go to there. For example, use the following command to go to the "Desktop" from the home directory:

```{eval=FALSE}
cd Desktop
```

Now when we hit "ls" we can see everything on our desktop:

### Going to where you need to go
Now that you know the **ls**, **cd**, and **pwd** commands, you can navigate through your computer just like you would with the finder (on a mac) or the file explorer (on a PC).

#### Exercise 2.a
Navigate to the directory that your COG bootcamp materials are in.

### Getting from A to B
In the previous exercise, did you find yourself repetitively using the **cd** command to go through various directories. One rule of thumb for coding is that if something is repetitive, there is probably a more efficient way to do it. In this case, we can give the **cd** command a path instead of a single directory to navigate to. 

#### Exercise 2.b
Start at your home directory and navigate to the "bash" subdirectory within the COG bootcamp directory.


## Managing Directories

### Creating new directories
To create a new directory, use the "make directory" command while providing a name to the new directory:
```{eval=FALSE}
mkdir test_directory
```
Here, we used an underscore to space out the words "test" and "directory". This is because navigating through directories that have a space or other weird characters in the name can be tricky. So to keep things simple, coders often use underscores instead of spaces.


### Creating subdirectories
We can also create subdirectories by giving a path and then the new subdirectory. The syntax for this is:
```{eval=FALSE}
mkdir path/to/new/filename
```

#### Exercise 2.c
Create a subdirectory within the new "test_directory" and name it "test_subdirectory".

### Moving things
We can use the "move" command to move directories and other files. Here is the syntax for that:
```{eval=FALSE}
mv path/to/file path/to/new/location
```

#### Exercise 2.d
Move the "test_subdirectory" directory back one level, so that it is in the "bash" directory.

### Renaming things
The move command can also be used to rename things. Normally, we would use the move command to move something to somewhere else by providing a path to the new location. To rename something, we won't provide a new path, but just the new name, like so:
```{eval=FALSE}
mv old_filename new_filename
```

#### Exercise 2.e
Rename "test_subdirectory" as "subject_data"
